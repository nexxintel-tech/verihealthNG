You are my senior full-stack engineer and mobile developer. Build the VeriHealth MVP exactly as specified. Follow all instructions strictly and autonomously create the required files, folders, and implementations. Maintain consistency across the entire project.

📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW

Build VeriHealth MVP, a cross-platform medical remote monitoring system that:

Collects health data hands-free:

iOS → Apple HealthKit Background Delivery

Android → Google Health Connect

Syncs data to Supabase in real time.

Generates automated AI risk insights using Supabase Edge Functions.

Displays clinician dashboards built in React + Tailwind.

Sends alerts and notifications via MessageBird.

Supports continuous monitoring of 16 medical conditions using vitals + behavioral metrics.

📌 MVP SCOPE

The MVP must support:

1. iOS Native App (Swift + HealthKit)

Apple HealthKit entitlement

Background delivery for HR, HRV, BP, SpO2, Sleep, Steps, Cycle data, Respiratory rate, Temperature

Offline sync → local queue → background push to Supabase

Authentication with Supabase (magic link or OTP)

Minimal UI: login + data sync status

2. Android Native App (Kotlin + Health Connect)

Health Connect permission model

Background sync for same metrics as above

Offline-first sync queue

Supabase integration

Minimal UI

3. Backend (Supabase)

Create schema + policies:

Tables:

users

vital_readings

conditions

risk_scores

alerts

sync_logs

Edge Functions:

calculate_risk_score (AI logic per condition)

generate_alerts

process_sync_event

Realtime:

Clinician dashboard receives updates live.

Auth:

Role-based access: patient, clinician, admin.

📌 4. Clinician Dashboard (React + Tailwind)

Features:

Login (Supabase)

Patient list + search

Risk scores overview

Individual patient timeline charts

Alerts panel

Condition-specific views
Charts: use Recharts.

📌 5. Conditions Supported

The system must compute risk alerts for 16 conditions:

Hypertension

Arrhythmia risk

Heart failure early signs

Respiratory disorders

Sleep disorders

Stress & burnout

Weight/obesity

Cardiometabolic risk

Diabetes early detection

Anaemia risk

CKD early detection

Infection detection

Pregnancy wellness

Fertility & menstruation

Sedentary lifestyle

Exercise recovery

Risk logic is simplified using heuristic thresholds + trends for MVP.

📌 TECH STACK

iOS app: Swift, HealthKit

Android app: Kotlin, Health Connect

Backend: Supabase

Dashboard: React + Tailwind

AI: Supabase Edge Functions

Notifications: MessageBird (WhatsApp/SMS)

📌 AGENTIC WORKING INSTRUCTIONS

Follow these rules continuously:

Autonomously create all files and folders needed for iOS, Android, backend, and dashboard.

Maintain consistent data models across all layers.

When generating code, include:

Imports

Full file paths

Full implementations

Comments

Validate HealthKit + Health Connect permissions.

Generate database migrations.

Use Supabase JS client on dashboard and mobile using REST or RPC endpoints.

Use background tasks for continuous sync.

Produce simple but clean UI (not UI-heavy).

Ask only when a hard external dependency cannot be resolved.

Everything should be optimized for a 7-day MVP finish.

📌 DELIVERY PRIORITY

Supabase schema + edge functions

iOS app structure

Android app structure

Dashboard

Integration tests

Deployment instructions

📌 FINAL INSTRUCTION

Begin by scaffolding the folder structure for the entire monorepo, then proceed to implement each component step-by-step.
Confirm architecture and start generating code immediately.
